@article{limit,
abstract = {Inductive power transfer (IPT) and capacitive power transfer (CPT) are the two most pervasive methods of wireless power transfer (WPT). IPT is the most common and is applicable to many power levels and gap distances. Conversely, CPT is only applicable for power transfer applications with inherently small gap distances due to constraints on the developed voltage. Despite limitations on gap distance, CPT has been shown to be viable in kilowatt power level applications. This paper provides a critical comparison of IPT and CPT for small gap applications, wherein the theoretical and empirical limitations of each approach are established. A survey of empirical WPT data across diverse applications in the last decade using IPT and CPT technology graphically compares the two approaches in power level, gap distance, operational frequency, and efficiency, among other aspects. The coupler volumetric power density constrained to small gap sizes is analytically established through theoretical physical limitations of IPT and CPT. Finally, guidelines for selecting IPT or CPT in small gap systems are presented.},
