This project aims to inform the reader about the usage of wireless power transfer. The project discusses the use of WPT in the past, the present and a possible future. This project uses mathematical modelling to give the reader an insight in magnetic inductive coupling. This paper is founded on basic knowledge of electromagnetism in addition to wireless power transfer. This knowledge is used in experiments of a LCR-circuit, in order to prove the connection between frequency and voltage, and thus the peak current at resonant frequency. Furthermore, an experiment to show the loss of power at increasing distance between sender and reciever. This paper concludes that resonant magnetic coupling will provide the most efficient energy transfer and will open up for further research on the subject matter for a future of more effecient long range wireless power transfer.
